			<documentation>Preferred width of content in Dialog. This property affects the width of dialog on phone in landscape mode,  tablet or desktop, because the dialog has a fixed width when runs on phone in portrait mode.

			<documentation>This property indicates if user can scroll horizontally inside dialog when the content is bigger than the content area. However, when scrollable control (sap.m.ScrollContainer, sap.m.Page) is in the dialog, this property needs to be set to false to disable the scrolling in dialog in order to make the scrolling in the child control work properly.
Dialog detects if there's sap.m.NavContainer, sap.m.Page, or sap.m.ScrollContainer as direct child added to dialog. If there is, dialog will turn off scrolling by setting this property to false automatically ignoring the existing value of this property.</documentation>
