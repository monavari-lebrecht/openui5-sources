<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">On top of pure CSS, SAPUI5 introduces advanced theming concepts and functions which can
		be used optionally.</p>
<p class="p">This includes the following:</p>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">CSS Variables, Functions and More</div><div type="CSS Variables, Functions and More">
			
			<p class="p">SAPUI5 uses the popular CSS preprocessor <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=http://lesscss.org/"> LESS<img src="images/3rd_link.png" class="link-external" alt="Information published on non-SAP site" title="Information published on non-SAP site" border="0"/></a>. This tool introduces several features, including
				CSS variables - a concept which also has been heavily demanded by the CSS community:
				in any UI5-controlled CSS file, variables can be defined and then be referenced
				anywhere in the CSS code of the same library. These variables are mainly used for
				colors. All CSS variables are global. The CSS variable concept contributes to a
				consistent way in implementing and changing the styles.</p>

			<p class="p">LESS adds more features like color calculations, mix-ins and CSS selector nesting. The color
				calculations are used in SAPUI5 to derive many different color shades from just a
				few variables.</p>

			<p class="p">Here is the syntax:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">@sapUiText: #000000; /* define the text color as 'black' */

button {
   color: @sapUiText; /* buttons will automatically have the current text color, which is '#000000' right now */
    [...]
}
</pre></div>

			<p class="p">The SAPUI5 theme generator then takes care of substituting all references to a CSS variable by
				the current value of this variable. This happens during the build of the control
				library.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> In development scenarios this LESS processing may even happen at runtime in the
				browser to shorten build time for SAPUI5 libraries. This is indicated by a
					<span class="ph uicontrol">less mode</span> rectangle when a page is launched.</div>

			<p class="p">Additionally, a specific theme can modify the CSS parameter values given by the base theme. So
				a control can just define its text color to use <samp class="ph codeph">sapUiText</samp> by
				default which will automatically take care of applying the correct color for every
				theme or user modification: The theme generation will create one CSS file per theme,
				and the substitution of the CSS parameter references will always take the
				theme-dependent value into account. So a visually very different theme can be easily
				created by just changing a couple of colors.</p>

			<p class="p">While every library and control can introduce their own CSS variables, those defined in
					<span class="ph filepath">global.css</span> are most important. Optimally, they should be
				few and simple enough to be understood by many end-users (similar to what the
				Windows operating system offers to end-users), but still cover enough aspects of the
				visual appearance to make them sufficient for many customer-required theme
				modifications. </p>

			
			<p class="p">Additional benefits of CSS variables are for example:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio45df6dff504647c686ab9ba72af827f6__ul_tlf_bqp_24"><li class="li">They can be used to generically build simple styling tools that allow a limited degree of
					freedom (=changing the CSS parameter values). The UI theme designer is an
					example for such a tool.</li>
<li class="li">They can also be linked to metadata like what group of colors they belong to, to
					which colors they need to have some visual contrast, etc.</li>
</ul>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Compilation of one css file</div><div type="Compilation of one css file">
			
			<p class="p">SAPUI5 CSS generation does not only substitute the CSS variable values but also takes care of
				bringing all CSS files from a control library into one file to be loaded at runtime,
				this increases the performance. The reasons to not have all styles defined within
				one file at development time are for example:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio45df6dff504647c686ab9ba72af827f6__ul_kmf_bqp_24"><li class="li">Less collisions and merging when different developers edit the styles of their
					controls.</li>
<li class="li">Clear separation between the styles for different controls (this helps greatly
					with estimating/testing the impact of a CSS modification)</li>
<li class="li">Keeping the door open for future optimizations regarding runtime performance and
					data transfer by tailoring CSS files on server-side that only contain the CSS
					required on the current application page.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Optimization and compression of css size</div><div type="Optimization and compression of css size">
			
			<p class="p">For performance reasons, the SAPUI5 CSS generation can optionally remove all comments and
				unnecessary whitespace and can collapse verbose declarations into a more compact
				format.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">"Clean" Browser switch available inside css code</div><div type="&#34;Clean&#34; Browser switch available inside css code">
			
			<p class="p">In all SAPUI5 application pages, the HTML root tag of the document gets the additional
				attribute <samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui-browser</samp> where the value is the type and the
				current browser version. When browser-specific CSS needs to be written, this
				attribute can be used in CSS selectors.</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">html[data-sap-ui-browser="ie8"] button {  /* this rule will only be applied if the current browser is Internet Explorer 8 */
   margin-top: 0px;
}

html[data-sap-ui-browser*="ie"] button {  /* this rule will only be applied if the current browser is ANY version of IE */
   padding-top: 0px;
}
</pre></div>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Base Theme for Always-required Style</div><div type="Base Theme for Always-required Style">
			
			<p class="p">While some of the style and layout applied using CSS is clearly depending on the current theme
				- and customers are likely to modify such style rules - there are other style rules
				that are required for a control to work properly and unlikely to differ for
				different themes. Examples are: the overflow behavior, positioning of popup
				elements, the mouse cursor type, the display mode and others more.</p>

			<p class="p">SAPUI5 promotes and supports keeping those style definitions in the so-called base theme,
				which serves as a common base for all themes.</p>

			<p class="p">Themes are built upon this base style, defining their specific visual design by applying
				colors and images, sizes and fonts. SAPUI5 theme generation takes care of combining
				the base theme with the specific theme for each generated theme CSS file. Because
				the specific CSS is appended to the base theme, a specific theme can always override
				styles defined in the base theme. If this step is required often, the respective
				style declaration probably should not be located in the base theme.</p>

			<p class="p">Any style declarations which are referencing CSS variables (at least those common
				ones defined in the base theme) can also be done in the base theme, and it is
				sufficient to do it only there: The CSS generation will apply the correct value for
				each respective theme. So this split between base theme and specific themes avoids
				double creation and maintenance of CSS parts which are common for all themes and
				keeps the CSS files smaller that need to be written for any new theme.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Generic Right-to-Left Support</div><div type="Generic Right-to-Left Support">
			
			<p class="p">For certain countries, RTL text mode (right-to-left) needs to be supported. In order to avoid
				the need to create a completely new set of CSS files for those countries, SAPUI5
				supports the generic RTL generation. Basically, right and left margins are
				exchanged, and much, much more (everything is mirrored, including CSS3 rotations
				etc.).</p>

			<p class="p">Everything else which is not covered by this automatic transformation can be fixed by
				style rules that are only applied in the RTL case.</p>
