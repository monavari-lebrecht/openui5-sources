<h1 class="title topictitle1">Transport Security</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="p">Security on the client and server side is not sufficient if the data transport between client and
			server can be read, intercepted, or even modified by an attacker. Per default, HTTP
			communication is stateless and unencrypted and this makes it necessary to configure it
			in a way that it is using encrypted connections and to add session handling on top using
			either cookies or URL rewriting. </p>

		<p class="p">Sending the HTTP protocol over a SSL secured
		  connection is not only standardized, but also required for SAP applications. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">SAPUI5 fully supports the use of HTTPS, but there
		  are some restrictions regarding the CDN version of SAPUI5 when HTTPS is used.
		  It is recommended to enable or at least to test SSL connections in an early
		  stage of application development, as usually switching to HTTPS causes some
		  issues. First of all, when the application is started using HTTPS, the SAPUI5
		  library also has to be loaded from an HTTPS server. Second, Internet Explorer 8
		  and 9 have some additional restrictions regarding cross origin requests with
		  HTTPS, which are related to the security zone concept.

		<p class="p">Even if the data transport is secured using SSL,
		  there are possibilities to hijack such a secure connection and sending
		  malicious requests from the client. Cross-site request forgery and session
		  fixation are two of the prominent examples of this class of attacks. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">SAPUI5 does only provide XSRF prevention for the
		  data, which is sent to the server by SAPUI5. Currently this only happens in the
		  OData Model, where a XSRF token is read from the server and used for subsequent
		  write requests. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">Application is responsible for using XSRF header or
		  other mechanisms to prevent XSRF for all other server communication triggered
		  by the application.
