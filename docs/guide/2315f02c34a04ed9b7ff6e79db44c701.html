<p class="p">You use the HTML5 sanitizer to clean up HTML5 code snippets by removing potentially executable
			JavaScript code. SAPUI5 reuses the HTML4 sanitizer by Google by adapting it for the use
			of HTML5 coding. The Google sanitizer also supports CSS3 coding. In addition, the HTML5
			sanitizer uses the URL white list which checks embedded URLs for correct formatting or
			against a given white list.</p>
<p class="p">For adapting the sanitizer to support HTML5, the HTML attributes and elements have been
			reorganized according to the current HTML5 specification from W3C. All types and flags
			have been  reviewed as accurately as possible and HTML4 elements that are no longer used
			in HTML5 have been removed. You can, however, still see them as comments. New or changed
			rules for HTML5 have been marked are "new" within the comments. The comments also state
			which attributes and elements are assigned to respective types and flags. All rules
			which were not 100% clear were analyzed in a way of similarity, so for example "audio"
			and "video" content behaves like images etc. URIEFFECTS state if a URL is loaded inplace
			within a tag where the actual document is in control of what type of content is loaded
			like "image" or if a new document is loaded like with "a href". LOADERTYPES state if
			content is loaded as sandboxed which means it is loaded within a specific surrounding
			player like with video content for example or if it is loaded freely without
			restrictions. Internally controls which accept arbitrary HTML content like the
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.richttexteditor.RichTextEditor</samp> or the
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.HTML</samp> use the HTML5 Sanitizer to sanitize the HTML code
			of their content and value to not infiltrate any dangerous coding. The option to
			sanitize the value can be enabled or disabled in the respective control properly via
			property: <samp class="ph codeph">RichTextEditor.sanitizeValue</samp> or
				<samp class="ph codeph">HTML.sanitizeContent</samp>. For the HTML control, it is disabled by
			default whereas for the RichTextEditor the sanitize option is enabled. </p>
