<h1 class="title topictitle1">Application Best Practices</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This guide tells you what you need to know to build non-trivial enterprise scale
		applications (apps) with UI5.</p>
<p class="p">UI5 is not a restrictive UI framework but more a collection of UI controls together with
			loosely coupled infrastructure components like basic MVC support, data binding,
			localization and others. This approach offers great flexibilty but also requires more
			care in application development and will most likely yield in heterogenous application
			structures.</p>
<p class="p">This document describes best practices on how to structure application projects along the
			most typical scenarios with a clean and consistent structure. Technically, the whole
			application could also just be coded into one single HTML file - and the simple "Hello
			World" applications are built exactly like this to make basic functionality easy to
			understand. But when creating reasonably complex applications a clean architecture is
			key for efficient development and maintainability. There are many degrees of freedom
			where this documentation decides for one of the possible options. E.g. when it comes to
			the file structure or the granularity of views or even the usage of the MVC concept at
			all. This does not mean that other options are wrong. In fact, other options may suit
			specific applications even better and some decisions also depend on project experience,
			team setup or plain taste. Nevertheless, this document should provide valuable
			suggestions for a good application structure, it's just important to know that this is
			not the only possible or correct way to build UI5 applications.</p>
<p class="p">This document contains sections that refer to concepts or controls which are only
			available in the sap.m library of UI5, but most suggestions are the same or very similar
			for desktop applications. Indeed, the controls in the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp> library are
			not just for "mobile", but for all platforms. They are designed to work responsively
			depending on the device on which they're running.</p>
<p class="p">In Part 1 of this document, "Preparing", we start with a high level overview of what aspects of
			UI5 development will be covered. We then describe the key features of an app, and why
			they're important. Along the way, references will be made to existing documentation
			where you can find out more information about a particular area.</p>
<p class="p">We'll look at design patterns, which are in common use across the web, but particularly
			in the SAP Fiori app suites. We'll also set the scene for the app that we'll build in
			this guide, by describing the business scenario.</p>
<p class="p">Finally, we'll discuss various conventions that are used throughout this document, and in
			particular, in the code examples. There are technical conventions such as the naming of
			variables, style conventions such as how a control definition will be laid out in XML,
			and conventions in terminology such as how we refer to the main control (often an
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.SplitApp</samp> or similar control) in a root view.</p>
<p class="p">In Part 2 "Building", we will start from scratch, and in a series of discrete steps, we
			will build the app that we described in the business scenario in Part 1. Each step
			covers a different aspect of app design and realisation. For example, there are sections
			on the UI5 bootstrap, the device model, routing, MVC and more. At the end of each
			section, we'll consider how far we've got in building the app, and show what the app
			looks like so far, so you know how far you should be if you're coding along
			yourself.</p>
<p class="p">This part of the guide is designed to be followed step by step, but is also written in
			such a way that you can also jump straight to a specific section and use it as reference
			when you're building your own apps in UI5. If you follow Part 2 step by step, you will
			end up with a fully functioning app that you can use as a starting point for other
			work.</p>
<p class="p">To give you an idea of where this document will take us, this is what the app will look
			like at the end of Part 2:</p>
