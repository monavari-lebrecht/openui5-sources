		sync. If data binding is implemented and defined properly, all changes in one data source
		are automatically reflected in the other data source.</p>
<p class="p">To achieve this, there is a <dfn class="term">model</dfn> and a <dfn class="term">data binding</dfn>. The
				<dfn class="term">model</dfn> instance holds the data and provides methods to set the data or
			to retrieve data from a server. It also provides a method for creating bindings to the
			data. When this method is called, a <dfn class="term">data binding</dfn> instance is created, which
			contains the binding information and provides an event, which is fired whenever the
			bound data is changed. An element can listen to this event and update its visualization
			according to the new data. </p>
<p class="p"> Usually, the UI uses data binding to bind UI controls to the model, which holds the
			application data, so that the controls are updated automatically whenever application
			data is changed. The data binding is also used when changes in the control cause updates
			in the underlying application data, such as data being entered by a user. This is called
			two-way binding.</p>
<p class="p">The default binding mode for model implementations (if not implemented otherwise) is
			two-way binding and the supported binding modes by the model are one-way binding,
			two-way binding and one-time binding. The default binding mode can be changed by the
			application for each model instance. A model implementation should specify its supported
			binding modes and set the default binding mode accordingly (e.g. if the model supports
			only one way binding the default binding mode should also be set to one way).</p>
