<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Key Features</div><div type="Key Features">
			
			<p class="p">The following SAP Smart Business modeler apps are available:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio28bb30fccab54b4a965c00d02a6ae343__ul_lct_2jj_n4"><li class="li">Create KPI<p class="p">You use this app to create KPIs or OPIs. Key performance indicators identify
						and measure the key metrics of a business. Operational performance
						indicators are similar to KPIs in that both measure the metrics of an aspect
						of a business. But while a KPI looks at broad categories (for example, car
						sales in particular country or region), an OPI measures a specific process
						or operation - typically one at a bottleneck for a business. For example, an
						OPI for a shipping company would look at orders shipped on time. You can
						save KPIs or OPIs in an intermediate state if the complete information is
						not yet available (for more information, see <a class="xref" href="2ee2365cbbdc405bad32401fee1a9fbb.html">Create KPI</a> under <span class="ph uicontrol">Related
							Links</span> in this document). For more information about statues,
						see section <span class="ph uicontrol">SAP Smart Business Entity Statuses</span> in
						this document.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Create Evaluation<p class="p">You create an evaluation to define a specific representation
						of a KPI or OPI, which means that you define a certain selection of the KPI
						data, the targets and thresholds that are relevant, together with some
						additional information. For example, you have defined a KPI to monitor car
						sales in a particular country. You can then create an evaluation that
						restricts the results to a certain area of that country for which one sales
						representative is responsible.</p>
<p class="p">You must specify an active KPI or OPI
						when you are creating an evaluation. The KPI data is copied to the
						evaluation as a proposal but you can overwrite it later.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Manage KPI Authorizations<p class="p">You use this app to authorize users or user roles
						for evaluations. An SAP Smart Business user can only see an evaluation, its
						tiles, and its drill-down views at runtime when you assign the user or role
						to the evaluation using this app and when you have activated all
						entities.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> An entity that you create using the SAP Smart Business
						modeler apps is not automatically visible to you when you logon to the
						runtime environment unless you have been authorized for the related
						evaluation.</div>
</li>
<li class="li">Configure KPI Tiles<p class="p">With this app, you configure tiles for active evaluations as the
						starting point for further analysis of a KPI or and OPI. At runtime, you
						click the KPI or OPI tile to open either an SAP Smart Business generic
						drill-down application or another type of specified analysis screen (for
						example, <span class="ph pname">SAP Lumira</span>). You can choose how to visualize the
						tile by selecting one of  the available tile types (numeric, comparison,
						trend, or actual vs. target).</p>
</li>
</ul>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio28bb30fccab54b4a965c00d02a6ae343__ul_dx5_mlj_n4"><li class="li">Configure KPI Drill-Down<p class="p">You use this app to configure different views, charts, filters,
						and associated KPIs for an active evaluation. You configure the drill-down
						so that you can analyze the KPI or OPI in further detail at runtime.
					</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Manage KPI Associations<p class="p">This app allows you to define a relationship between
						active KPIs. You can choose to define either a supporting or a conflicting
						association depending on the relationship between the two KPIs. Supporting
						associations apply when the two KPIs influence each other in a positive way,
						for example, the net advertisement cost and the cost of manufacturing for
						goods contribute to the cost of goods sold KPI. Conflicting associations
						apply when two KPIs influence each other in a negative way, for example, the
						net sales and net cost KPIs are associated in a conflicting way to provide a
						value for the net revenue KPI.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">KPI Workspace<p class="p">The KPI Workspace app allows you to access all of your KPIs or
						OPIs in one place. You can activate, edit, delete, or duplicate a KPI or OPI
						as well as add them to your favorites.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Migration Tool<p class="p">Former versions of SAP Smart Business used a different
						architecture. You can use the migration tool app to migrate old KPIs and
						related entities to the latest version of SAP Smart Business, which offers
						improved usability and a newly designed user interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Interaction Between SAP Smart Business Modeler Apps</div><div type="Interaction Between SAP Smart Business Modeler Apps">
			
			<p class="p">KPIs and OPIs are the central entities of SAP Smart Business. You can create KPIs and OPIs
				using the <span class="ph pname">Create KPI</span> app. Based on this KPI or OPI, you can then
				create an evaluation using the <span class="ph pname">Create Evaluation</span> app. </p>

			<p class="p">When you have created an evaluation, you must choose a tile to visualize the KPI or OPI using
				the Configure KPI Tiles app. This lets you define how the tile appears in the
				runtime environment (for example, the SAP Fiori Launchpad). You must then define
				what happens when the SAP Smart Business user clicks the KPI or OPI tile at runtime.
				You define this using the <span class="ph pname">Configure KPI Drill-Down</span> app.</p>

			<p class="p">If required, you can define associations between KPIs using the <span class="ph pname">Manage KPI
					Associations</span> app. You can add associated KPIs to a KPIâ€™s drill-down
				where they are displayed in the header area in the form of KPI mini charts.Finally,
				you must define which user or user role can access the evaluation and related
				entities at runtime. You do this using the <span class="ph pname">Manage KPI Authorizations</span>
				app.</p>

			<p class="p">You can manage all KPIs, OPIs, and evaluations that are available in the system through the
					<span class="ph pname">KPI Workspace</span> app. If you have used previous versions of SAP
				Smart Business, you can migrate your existing KPIs and related entities to the new
				SAP Smart Business version using the <span class="ph pname">Migration Tool</span> app.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">SAP Smart Business Modeler App Users</div><div type="SAP Smart Business Modeler App Users">
			
			<p class="p">The SAP Fiori Launchpad enables you to find and retain the modeler apps required to
				carry out your work (for example, by using role-based allocation of default apps and
				app groups and personalization to add or remove additional apps from a global
				catalog).</p>

			<p class="p">To create new KPIs, you must understand related KPIs from the same and from different
				business areas. You must also be aware of the implications from a business
				perspective of introducing the new KPI. Therefore, the <span class="ph pname">Create KPI</span> and
				the <span class="ph pname">Manage KPI Associations</span> apps are used principally by data
				analysts or operations office employees. In addition, technical knowledge and
				alignment with development teams that build SAP HANA views is required to link a KPI
				to a data source and provide the required input parameters. </p>

			<p class="p">IT administrative knowledge is required to authorize users and roles for evaluations
				and to define navigation targets for KPI tiles. Therefore, the <span class="ph pname">Manage KPI
					Authorizations</span>, <span class="ph pname">Create Evaluation</span>, and <span class="ph pname">Configure
					KPI Tiles</span> apps are used principally by IT personnel.</p>

			<p class="p">Business knowledge is required to configure the drill-down views correctly and as a
				result the <span class="ph pname">Configure KPI Drill-Down</span> app is used mainly by data
				analysts and power users that are close to business users who benefit from and use
				the drill-down views at runtime. </p>

			<p class="p">All user groups benefit from the versatility that the <span class="ph pname">KPI Workspace</span>
				app provides to search and browse through the KPI repository.</p>
