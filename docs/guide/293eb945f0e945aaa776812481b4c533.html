<h1 class="title topictitle1">Running SAPUI5 Mobile Apps in Hybrid Web Containers</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"/>
<p class="p">SAPUI5 provides the following two options for building mobile apps:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio293eb945f0e945aaa776812481b4c533__ul_e4s_qdd_yl"><li class="li">
				<p class="p">Building the app as a web application loaded from a URL</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Building the app as an hybrid app consisting of a native app wrapper, for example
					PhoneGap, and an HTML viewer to display the SAPUI5 content on the user
					interface.</p>

			</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Hybrid apps have the advantage that you can publish them in app stores. Also, by embedding the
			application code in hybrid apps and the SAPUI5 library files in the hybrid container,
			the user needs to install the files only once and does <strong class="ph b">not</strong> need to download them
			every time he starts the application. But then the library size becomes important,
			because every user has to install the files, whereas in web applications the library is
			deployed on a server and the user only needs to download the required parts of the
			library at runtime.</p>
<p class="p">To include the SAPUI5 resources you need in your hybrid app, SAPUI5 mobile provides the
			following static mobile runtime packages: <samp class="ph codeph">sapui5-mobile-opt-static.zip</samp>
			or <samp class="ph codeph">sapui5-mobile-static.zip</samp>.</p>
<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
			<p class="p">The packages are <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> contained in the SAPUI5 runtime deployment. The
				packages are contained, for example, in the SCN download version of SAPUI5 and in
				the Open Source version OpenUI5 (file name in the OpenUI5 release:
					<samp class="ph codeph">openui5-runtume-mobile*.zip</samp>)</p>

		</div>
<p class="p">The library size of these packages is rather small because the content that is most likely not
			needed has been removed, for example test pages. A package contains the debug version of
			all JavaScript files and the optimized and minimized version. Thus, you can use the
			package for productive use as well as for debugging purposes. To use this package in an
			app wrapper, such as PhoneGap, unzip the package in the respective resource location of
			the app development project. The app wrapper build then includes the files and makes
			them available at runtime.</p>
<p class="p">To ensure that the file is small, it only contains the control libraries that are most likely
			used and not all control libraries. Depending on the hybrid app it may be necessary to
			add libraries by copying them from the respective folder of the SAPUI5 runtime, or to
			delete libraries to reduce the package size and, thus, also reduce the installation size
			for the user.</p>
<p class="p">The SAPUI5 version contains the following control libraries:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio293eb945f0e945aaa776812481b4c533__ul_awl_zjh_gn"><li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.unified</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.me</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.makit</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ca.ui</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ca.scfld</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.viz</samp></p>

			</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The OpenUI5 version contain the following control libraries:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio293eb945f0e945aaa776812481b4c533__ul_tz5_vlh_gn"><li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.suite</samp></p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.unified</samp></p>

			</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Optimization of the Package Size</div><div type="Optimization of the Package Size">
			
			<p class="p">Although the static SAPUI5 package is small enough to be included in hybrid apps, you can
				reduce the size further and optimize the content for a specific application by
				deleting additional files. The following list gives some examples:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio293eb945f0e945aaa776812481b4c533__ul_etb_myv_xl"><li class="li">
					<p class="p">You can delete one of the following files from the <samp class="ph codeph">/resources</samp> folder
						depending on your setup: <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-core-nojQuery.js</samp> if you
						reference SAPUI5 normally or <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-core.js</samp> if you
						reference the <samp class="ph codeph">nojQuery</samp> version and reference the
							<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery</samp> version separately, for example if you run in a
						Sybase hybrid container.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">You can delete all library folders if the respective control library is not needed. If you
						do not use charts, you can delete the complete <samp class="ph codeph">makit</samp> and
							<samp class="ph codeph">viz</samp> folder in <samp class="ph codeph">/resources/sap</samp>. And in
						the OpenUI5 version you can, for example, delete the <samp class="ph codeph">suite</samp>
						and the <samp class="ph codeph">unified</samp> folder if you do not need them.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">If you use the <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-core.js</samp> file for bootstrap, you can
						delete the <samp class="ph codeph">jquery</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">jqueryui</samp> folders in
							<samp class="ph codeph">/resources/sap/ui/thirdparty</samp>. These files may be needed
						when you use the <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-core-nojQuery.js</samp> script, but if you
						have another copy of <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery</samp> available you can still delete
						the folder.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Depending on the theme you use, you can delete the <samp class="ph codeph">base</samp> and
						either the <samp class="ph codeph">sap_bluecrystal</samp> or the <samp class="ph codeph">sap_mvi</samp>
						folders in each of the <samp class="ph codeph">/resources/sap/* ... */themes</samp>
						folders.</p>

				</li>
</ul>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">For all JavaScript files, an optimized version and a debug (dbg) version  exists. If you
					delete the files, make sure that you always delete both versions. If you can do
					without easy debugging and want to achieve a minimum installation size instead,
					you can delete all <samp class="ph codeph">*-dbg.js</samp> files.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">You can delete further files, but the size reduction is limited and to find out the files that
				are not required gets increasingly difficult.</p>

			<p class="p">You can also <strong class="ph b">add</strong> additional control libraries by copying the respective folder from the
					<samp class="ph codeph">sapui5-static.zip</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">openui5-runtime-*.zip</samp>
				file. The control libraries are identical and can be used interchangeably provided
				that they have the exactly same version.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section" id="loio293eb945f0e945aaa776812481b4c533__section_N10018_N10011_N10001"><div class="section_title">Device Ready Event</div><div type="Device Ready Event">
			
			<p class="p">The hybrid web container needs some time for initialization. During this time, the
				sending of AJAX requests is blocked, meaning that JavaScript code stops once an AJAX
				request is sent and the code execution stops as well. This leads to a UI freeze
				effect.</p>

			<p class="p">The oData model in SAPUI5 uses AJAX requests internally and the oData model initialization
				must therefore be done after the hybrid container is ready to avoid a user interface
				freeze. After initialization, the hybrid web containers fires an event, which is
				called <samp class="ph codeph">deviceready</samp> in PhoneGap. To fix this issue, move the code
				where the oData model is created and set to the core object or any other controls'
				model property to the deviceready event listener.</p>

			<p class="p">Example:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">&lt;script&gt;
&lt;!-- put the following code in the beginning of the application code --&gt;
function appReady(){
    sap.ui.getCore().setModel(new sap.ui.model.odata.ODataModel(&lt;ODATA_URL&gt;, false));
}
&lt;!-- bind to the deviceready event --&gt;
document.addEventListener("deviceready", appReady, false);
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>

		</div></div>
<div class="section" id="loio293eb945f0e945aaa776812481b4c533__section_N1003A_N10011_N10001"><div class="section_title">Cross Domain Restrictions</div><div type="Cross Domain Restrictions">
			
			<p class="p">If you load data from an external server or service using AJAX, the external domain has to be
				configured inside the hybrid web container to make the AJAX request go through the
				cross domain restriction. The following findings result from an integration of the
				SAPUI5 demo applications into PhoneGap:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio293eb945f0e945aaa776812481b4c533__ul_fpg_41x_2j"><li class="li">
					<p class="p">Android</p>

					<p class="p">If the AJAX code runs inside the webview in Android, no cross domain restriction exists.
						This means that you can load data using AJAX from everywhere. The PhoneGap
						documentation, however, still says that the domain needs to be configured in
						one XML file.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">iOS</p>

					<p class="p">The restriction in webview in iOS still exists and you need to add the domain that is
						visited using AJAX to a white list file to bypass the restriction. For
						detailed information about the white list file, see the PhoneGap
						documentation on the PhoneGap website.</p>
