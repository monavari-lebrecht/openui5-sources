<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Fragments are pieces of UI, just like SAPUI5 MVC views, but without the view control
		around the content and without their own controller. </p>
<p class="p">UI parts which are to be used in several views cannot be easily defined. Either they have
			to be created as new controls, or they have to be created as views. Creating them as new
			controls results in a development overhead, while creating them as separate views
			results in a runtime overhead. In the latter case they would have a separate controller
			instead of having the same controller as the view does. </p>
<p class="p">Furthermore, views and popup controls like dialogs do not go well together - the dialog content
			can be defined as a view but the dialog control itself always has to be written in the
			program. </p>
<p class="p">To solve these issues, fragments have been introduced as a new concept. Fragments are
			light-weight UI parts (UI sub-trees) which can be re-used, defined similar to views, but
			do not have any controller or other behavior code involved. If source code is required,
			and for event handler methods, they should be able to connect to existing controllers of
			the "owning" view. This means that one important characteristic of fragments is that
			they are independent of the MVC concept and can be used without using MVC. However, if
			fragments are used together with views and controllers, fragments can make use of them
			and integrate them neatly.</p>
<p class="p">Similar to <span class="keyword apiname">DocumentFragments</span> in HTML, the fragment itself has no HTML
			representation when it is inserted into a UI5 UI tree. Instead, its content is inserted.
			This means that fragments are not like controls, but more like a factory creating the
			contained controls. They support re-use and view modularization without adding overhead. </p>
<p class="p">Because of the huge similarities of fragments and the definition and usage of MVC views,
			it is important to be familiar with the SAPUI5 MVC concept. Many topics, such as the
			fragment content definition, are identical. A link is provided below in the related
			links section. </p>
<p class="p">The reason why there are different types of fragments is because usecases are different
			and because some developers prefer declarative UIs while others prefer to
			programmatically construct them. There is no best choice, but the suggestions when to
			use which view type also apply to fragments. </p>
<p class="p">At the moment there are three different types of fragments: </p>
