<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"/>
<p class="p">The following sections provide information on common issues.</p>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">An Empty Page Comes Up</div><div type="An Empty Page Comes Up">
			
			<p class="p">An empty page is most likely caused by a JavaScript error. JavaScript errors stop all
				subsequent execution.</p>

			<p class="p">To solve the issue, check the browser's JavaScript console or the Firefox error
				console. If they do not indicate that an error has occurred, check if you added the
				UI controls to an existing element in the page by using <samp class="ph codeph">placeAt(â€¦)</samp>.
				If this is not the cause, check in the browser's DOM inspector whether this
				"existing element" actually contains child HTML which resembles the controls you
				have added. Check if the HTML elements are set to be visible and check the
				dimensions. The height (or width) may have collapsed to zero, thus making the
				element invisible. This happens, for example, if an HTML element with no height set
				has a child element with a height set to 100%, as this height refers to the height
				of the parent element with an undefined height.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Content or Control is not Visible</div><div type="Content or Control is not Visible">
			
			<p class="p">If content or a control is not visible, check in the DOM inspector of your browser
				whether the respective HTML exists in the document, or not. You can either search
				for the control ID or drill down the control hierarchy. It is often the case that
				the height has collapsed to zero, thus making the element invisible. A possible
				cause is if you have set no height for an HTML element, but set the height for a
				child element to 100%. The 100% refer to the height of the parent element with an
				undefined height, meaning that the child element wants to be as tall as its parent.
				You can also check whether the control and its parents are set to <em class="ph i">visible</em>.
				Or, if you use data binding, check if the elements are properly bound. You can also
				use the support tool for this check.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Content or Control is set to 100% Height, but Setting Does not Work</div><div type="Content or Control is set to 100% Height, but Setting Does not Work">
			
			<p class="p">Check the height settings of the parent elements. In CSS, a percentage height only
				works when the parent has a defined height. This issue is often caused by parent
				elemnt with no height setting or again a percentage height and one ancestor with no
				defined height. In CSS, this results in a height that is collapsed to the minimum
				height accomodating all content. Some typical controls, however, adapt their height
				to the content are the sap.ui.core.View (all types) and the sap.m.Page controls. By
				setting the View height to any fixed height or setting the View and all ancestors to
				100% height, you can define its height and 100%-height children will work fine. And
				the Page control can be set to enableScrolling: false: when scrolling is allowed,
				the scroll container in the Page control grows with the content, but when you want
				to set the content to 100% height scrolling does not make sense because by
				definition there is no scrolling when the content is as tall as the available
				space.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Proportions of a Rendered Control Look Odd</div><div type="Proportions of a Rendered Control Look Odd">
			
			<p class="p">Check if the doctype is set correctly in your page. Some controls are not rendered
				correctly if the doctype is missing or is not correct. Table headers, for example,
				become exceptionally high.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Style of an Application or a Control Looks Odd</div><div type="Style of an Application or a Control Looks Odd">
			
			<p class="p">Check if  you have used custom styles in your application. If yes, they probably
				collide with styling in the theming libraries. One approach is to use the browser's
				debugging tools to inspect the element which has the wrong styling. You can usually
				see on the <span class="ph uicontrol">HTML</span> tab which styles are applied to a DOM
				element. If you have styles in the list that your application adds, disable these
				styles in the debugger to see whether this solves the problem. Note that
				SAPUI5-specific CSS classes and IDs start with a sapUi prefix, for example,
					<samp class="ph codeph">sapUiButton</samp>.</p>

			<p class="p">If this does not solve the issue, check for inline styles that are be applied to the element
				in the HTML code. You can also try to isolate the control from the application to
				see if there is an issue with the control instead of a collision of styles.</p>

			<p class="p">If none of the above solves the problem and the issue does not seem to be application
				specific, open a CSS message. </p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Console Shows an Error Indicating That Something is Wrong With SAP-UI-CORE.JS, Line 2</div><div type="Console Shows an Error Indicating That Something is Wrong With SAP-UI-CORE.JS, Line 2">
			
			<p class="p">Although an issue in <samp class="ph codeph">SAP-UI-CORE.JS</samp> is not impossible, the error often
				originates elsewhere. To find the actual issue, activate the SAPUI5 debugging
				sources. This enables you to see in more detail where the message is thrown and it
				gives you the opportunity to set a breakpoint at the corresponding line. From there,
				you can dig deeper into the problem and also have a look at the call stack to see
				where it has started.</p>
