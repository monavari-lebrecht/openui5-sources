<p class="p">SAPUI5 provides the following two types of components:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0__ul_dt4_hyw_4k"><li class="li">
				<p class="p">Faceless components (class: <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Component</samp>)</p>

				<p class="p">Faceless components do <strong class="ph b">not</strong> have a user interface and are used, for example, for a
					service that delivers data from a back-end system.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">UI components (class: <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.UIComponent</samp>)</p>

				<p class="p">UI components extend components and add rendering functionality to the component.
					They represent a screen area or element on the user interface, for example, a
					button or a shell, along with the respective settings and metadata.</p>

			</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Component</samp> class is the base class for UI and faceless
			components and provides the metadata for both types of components. To extend the
			functionality, components can inherit from their base class or from another
			component.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">name</samp> parameter that gets passed into the component constructor
			represents the package name under which your component can be found. The <samp class="ph codeph">module
				name</samp>' of the component is package name + <samp class="ph codeph">.Component</samp>. You
			specify the module name in <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.declare</samp> and in the
				<samp class="ph codeph">extend</samp> methods of the <samp class="ph codeph">Component.js</samp>.</p>
<div class="section" id="loio958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0__section_N10059_N10011_N10001"><div class="section_title">Structure of a Component</div><div type="Structure of a Component"><p class="p">A component
				is a folder. The folder name defines the component name and contains all optional
				and required resources that are used in the component except for the required SAPUI5
				libraries and child components. Optional resources are, for example, the CSS and
				internationalization files, views, and images. The following files are mandatory for
				components:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0__ul_fh2_1ky_4k"><li class="li">
					<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">component.js</samp></p>

					<p class="p">This is the component controller and provides the runtime metadata
						(properties, aggregation, events) and the component methods. The
							<samp class="ph codeph">name</samp> parameter that is passed to the component
						constructor represents the package name under which you can find the
						component.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">component.json</samp></p>

					<p class="p">This is the component descriptor and contains the design-time metadata. The file is not
						loaded during runtime. The file is currently not used, but may be used in
						the future for design-time tools.</p>

				</li>
</ul>
<div class="note note" id="loio958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0__note_N10076_N10011_N10001"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> All paths within a component are relative
				paths to the <samp class="ph codeph">component.js</samp> file and <strong class="ph b">not</strong> to the
					<samp class="ph codeph">index.html</samp> file.</div>
<p class="p">The following figure gives an example
				of a component folder structure.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Differentiation to Other Concepts in SAPUI5</div><div type="Differentiation to Other Concepts in SAPUI5">
			
			<p class="p">The following list explains how other concepts used in SAPUI5 are distinguished from
				the SAPUI5 components concept:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0__ul_xc4_nfl_kn"><li class="li">
					<p class="p">Composite controls</p>

					<p class="p">Both concepts provide a set of controls behind a single interface. Composite
						controls are intended for reuse within control development and allow to
						include existing controls in a complex control wheras components are
						intended for reuse in application development.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">UI library</p>

					<p class="p">The UI library is the deployable unit around controls: Controls are never deployed
						standalone, but as part of a control library. Components, however, are
						self-contained and should <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> be used to deploy
						controls.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Notepad control</p>

					<p class="p">A notepad control is another way to define a control. Notepad controls have all the
						characteristics of a control.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">MVC</p>

					<p class="p">The MVC concept allows to define views and controllers and, thus, to structure and reuse
						parts within an application. As MVC can only be deployed separately and has
						no means to define dependent styles or scripts that are loaded together with
						a view, this concept is of limited use across different applications.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Application</p>
Applications have a single start URL and contain everything belonging to
					the application in a deployable unit. However, it is <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span>
					possible to embed an application into another application as the knowledge about
					the required libraries, scripts and additional stylesheets is contained in the
					index.html.</li>
