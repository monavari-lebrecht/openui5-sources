<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"/>
<p class="p">Mobile devices usually have a limited memory and processing power. Complex web pages may
			therefore have a negative impact on the application performance. This also depends on
			the mobile device.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.List</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Table</samp> controls are most likely
			affected by this as they are often bound to data sources and often dynamically generate
			list items or table rows. The data may contain a large number of elements. Apart from
			the performance, creating long lists or tables on mobile devices also affects usability:
			navigating through large data sets on a mobile device is less convenient than on the
			desktop. We recommend to restrict the number of elements in lists or tables to 100 on
			mobile devices.</p>
<p class="p">If a list contains too many items, the device needs more time for rendering and the user
			has to wait before he can see the list or table on the device. The scrolling behavior
			may also be affeted. To reduce the number of items that must be rendered initially, you
			can use the <samp class="ph codeph">growing</samp> feature for the list or table. With this feature,
			subsequent loads will not trigger a rerendering of the complete list and are more
			performant. However, if a re-rendering of the entire list is triggered for another
			reason, the rendering may have a reduced performance. </p>
