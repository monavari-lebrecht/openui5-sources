<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Understanding aspects of an enterprise scale application.</p>
<p class="p">This part of the guide describes the aspects of an enterprise scale app written in UI5. Each
			aspect is described here in terms of functionality â€” what an aspect brings to an app,
			and why it's important. If you're looking for in-depth code examples, you'll find that
			in Part 2 "Building".</p>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Approach</div><div type="Approach">
			
			<p class="p">With a toolkit as comprehensive as UI5, it is natural to find there are many ways to
				achieve a particular goal. Whether that is at a small scale, such as how to process
				a list of items in JavaScript, or at a large scale, such as how to declaratively
				define a User Interface (UI), you will see that UI5 offers choice. In the latter
				example, you can declaratively define a UI in JSON, XML or HTML. Which one should
				you choose?</p>

			<p class="p">Different circumstances such as developer skillset, preference, tools and standards
				may favor one way over another, and may influence your choice. The choice may be on
				an app-by-app basis; more likely, within the enterprise context, the choice will be
				influenced by standards and the desire to be consistent. This guide, in particular
				in Part 2 "Building", has been deliberately written to forgo the pros-and-cons
				approach, and to focus on being specific. Nevertheless, you'll find references to
				other existing material that does cover the different possibilities of a given
				aspect. Continuing with the view definition example, the options are covered in
				great detail in the MVC section of the SDK.</p>

			<p class="p">The benefits of this prescriptive-with-reference approach is that we can focus on each task in
				hand, and get to a best practice solution quickly, while not losing the
				overview.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Definition of an App</div><div type="Definition of an App"><div class="sectiondiv"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Independent</span><p class="p">An app,
					by definition, is independent. But there's more to it than that. First, let's
					examine what independent means, in this sense. If an app is independent, it is
					standalone, can be found, discovered or simply initiated (say, from a bookmark
					or icon) and can be used without necessarily having to be contained within a
					larger framework. </p>
<p class="p">With our UI5 apps being written in JavaScript (yes, and
					there are declarative parts too that don't have to be in JavaScript), we need to
					have at least a small structure that is native to the runtime context's
					features, a structure that is bookmarkable and that can facilitate the loading
					of the UI5 runtime and the app itself. That structure, at the bare minimum, is
					an HTML page. </p>
<p class="p">While that HTML page serves as a delivery mechanism for the
					UI5 app, it should not do much more than that. As well as being independently
					discoverable and startable, the app itself - the UI5 parts from which it is
					constructed, should also be independent of the HTML page. That is to say, we
					should ideally be able to take the app, and the functionality it offers, and
					embed it into another structure, and have it live and run there just as happily.
					</p>
<p class="p">For those of you acquainted with the standard delivery mechanism for the
					SAP Fiori suite of apps, this is something that may be familiar - the Launchpad,
					which is the HTML-based user-facing part of the Unified Shell
					infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p">Whether you intend your app to run within such a framework
					or not, designing it with this feature in mind has benefits not only relating to
					independence and runtime frameworks, but also relating to construction across
					different development teams. An app, or part of an app, developed as an
					independent unit, lends itself more to being constructed and delivered by
					separate teams working on a greater whole (say, a suite of related
					functions).</p>
<div class="p">So what does that mean for us as an app developer with UI5? It
					means that we should build our apps using the Component concept. Being a
					component means that the app can be delivered and run within a simple,
					standalone HTML page, or within the wider context of a Launchpad. If you
					construct your component correctly, this will be possible. It also means that we
					should reduce the content of the standalone HTML page to the bare essentials<ul class="ul" id="loiof377376842914da7a6716192ecffc9d0__ul_mq1_gxl_mn"><li class="li">meta tags in the document header to give the browser the best hints at
							rendering our app correctly</li>
<li class="li">a script tag, known as the UI5 bootstrap, which loads the UI5 runtime
							core</li>
<li class="li">an appropriately marked up HTML body into which the UI5 controls can be
							places</li>
<li class="li">minimal UI5 logic executed when the runtime has been loaded; this logic
							is to create an <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.ComponentContainer</samp> and point to
							our app component which will be then automatically retrieved and
							loaded</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">UI5 apps are configurable in the bootstrap; however best practice
					states that bootstrap configuration (attributes that start with the prefix
						<samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui</samp>) should be kept to a minimum. As an example,
					you should specify the theme, and tell the runtime where it should expect to
					find the resources (your component file, your views and controllers, and so on),
					based on the names you've used within your app. There are a number of ways that
					you can tell the module loading mechanism where to find things; the best way is
					to use the <samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui-resourceroots</samp> parameter.</p>
<p class="p">What
					should you call this standalone HTML page? You can of course use any name you
					want, however, exercise restraint. Common names are <samp class="ph codeph">index.html</samp>
					or <samp class="ph codeph">main.html</samp>. These names are perfectly fine; you may or may
					not want your web server to automatically serve up a default HTML page if the
					containing folder is requested. To highlight the fact that the HTML file is
					mainly a delivery mechanism for your app for when it's being initiated in a
					standalone fashion (as opposed to within the wider context of a Launchpad),
					another common name is
					<samp class="ph codeph">localIndex.html</samp>.</p>
</div><div class="sectiondiv"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Addressable</span><p class="p">That
					an app should be "addressable" is closely related to some of the aspects of the
					"independent" feature. One of the underlying design goals of a non-trivial
					application should be the possibility of 'deep linking' to certain application
					states. What this means is a user should be able to bookmark places in an app,
					and be able to resume where they left off.</p>
<p class="p">This doesn't necessarily mean
					that intermediate application state should be preserved at all times. Rather,
					for example, it means that I should be able to send my colleague a bookmarked
					URL that points to the detail page for a specific product in a Product Info app,
					and for my colleague to be taken directly to that same place on retrieval of
					that URL (authorizations permitting, of course).</p>
<p class="p">We don't expect to have
					to start at the top level of a website and descend through the links to the
					specific page each time we want information from that page - we just navigate
					directly to where we need to go. With an HTML5 app we can and should offer the
					same experience where possible.
					</p>
</div><div class="sectiondiv"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">UI-Focused</span><p class="p">A fully featured
					app consists of backend and frontend logic. Data services and a user interface.
					The backend should be developed and maintained separately from the frontend, and
					there should be a clear separation of concerns. Beyond this basic separation,
					the individual user interface (UI) parts of an app can and should be developed
					separately too. UI5 supports the Model View Controller (MVC) concept, and you
					are encouraged to use MVC to keep the data model handling, the UI design and the
					application logic separate. Furthermore, encapsulate your real and test data
					services within Models, and this will help you focus on the UI. </p>
<p class="p">In order
					to build the frontend separately and effectively, a developer needs test data.
					There are many ways of facilitating this, and we'll cover some of them in Part 2
					"Building". </p>
<p class="p">The connection between the backend and frontend is made in
					the app's core, which in our case is the
					Component.</p>
</div><div class="sectiondiv"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Responsive</span><p class="p">Rather
					than focus on "mobile", we actually want to build our app so that it makes the
					best use of available screen real-estate regardless of device. In other words,
					we want it to be responsive, adjusting to smartphone, tablet and desktop-sized
					screens. The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp> library within the UI5 toolkit is designed
					from the ground up for this very requirement. There are controls from other
					libraries that we'll use for our app, particularly from the
						<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout</samp> library and a few from the core (such as the
					Item) and of course our use of Model View Controller (MVC) will see us working
					with controls from the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.mvc</samp> library too.</p>
<div class="p">In
					the main, we'll use the sap.m controls. But there's more to it that that.
					Different devices have different capabilities (for example touch) and navigation
					and selection events need to be offered and handled slightly differently. So we
					need to make sure navigation back buttons appear appropriately (or not), and to
					make sure that the items in a list are properly selectable according to the
					device on which they're being presented. For this, we create a so-called "Device
					Model". This is a client data model (the sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel is ideal
					for this) that is created when the application is initialized, and the
					properties within are usually one of two types:<ul class="ul" id="loiof377376842914da7a6716192ecffc9d0__ul_nwk_5yl_mn"><li class="li">boolean: these relate to whether the device has touch capabilities, for
							example </li>
<li class="li">single-value: these relate to list and list item settings such as the
								<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.ListMode</samp> and
							<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.ListType</samp></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">The properties are especially useful in declarative views, where no
					condition logic is allowed. In effect, the condition logic ("is this device
					touch-capable?") is being done once, up
					front.</p>
</div><div class="sectiondiv"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Accessible</span><p class="p">Accessibility is an important factor in app design.
					UI5 apps are no exception. There are a few aspects that one should consider when
					developing a UI5 app. The first is keyboard support; that is built in with the
					sap.m controls, so if you make use of the sap.m controls you are getting
					keyboard handling support for free.</p>
<p class="p">Finally, you need to remember that if
					you decide to use native HTML to enhance certain parts of your app, you must
					take care that these parts also exhibit keyboard and visual support for
					accessibility.</p>
</div><div class="sectiondiv"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Translateable</span><p class="p">Some
					apps are built with a specific, geographically restricted audience in mind. In
					those cases, texts that become part of the UI, such as label content, the text
					on buttons, headings, messages and so on, could be hard-coded - baked into the
					UI definition itself. But in many circumstances the audience for any given app
					is geographically diverse, and so it follows that localization is necessary,
					sometimes with different languages within the same country or region. This
					localization requirement is driven either implicitly by a user's locale
					settings, or explicitly via parameters. With localization, right-to-left (RTL)
					languages should also be supported, and sap.m controls support RTL.</p>
<p class="p">In
					these cases, it makes sense to manage the static texts of an app separately, in
					a way that they can be substituted with versions in different locales. Because
					of the localization mechanism available with UI5, this is simple to do. In fact
					it's so simple that even development of those single-geography apps, where the
					texts would otherwise be hard-coded, should consider using the same
					mechanism.</p>
<p class="p">The static texts need to be managed in a way that they can be
					contextualized and translated, often by specialist teams, independent of the app
					development process, and without affecting or requiring modification to the apps
					core logic.</p>
</div><div class="sectiondiv"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Maintainable</span><p class="p">All
					but the simplest of apps become complex very quickly. They have lots of moving
					parts, which serve different purposes. Some parts are related to the management
					of the connection to, and usage of, the backend data and services. Others are
					related to the application logic, while others still relate to determining how
					the UI appears to the user.</p>
<p class="p">Larger apps have these challenges and more;
					they may consist of multiple collections of these moving parts, and these
					collections, and parts within, may have to be developed and maintained by
					separate teams.</p>
<p class="p">In these contexts UI5 has a couple of features to help
					make your app maintainable. Firstly, it supports the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
					concept, which supports the discrete concerns of data handling, presentation,
					and logic. This means not only that you can keep a clean separation between
					them, but also more easily allow different people, or groups of people to
					develop together. Secondly it has the concept of a Component, which is an
					application unit that can be developed independently and then used (and re-used)
					to supply app functionality as a whole or in parts.</p>
<p class="p">Finally both these
					features allow for a more focused maintenance; for example, it should be
					possible to modify the way a part of an application looks without worrying about
					adversely affecting the business logic.</p>
</div></div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Design Patterns</div><div type="Design Patterns">
			
			<p class="p">With HTML5 as a technology basis, apps can naturally take on many different designs.
				For enterprise scale apps, an aspect of app design that is as important as the way
				the app looks is the way the app looks in relation to other apps. In other words,
				design consistency. Beyond being functional and fit for purpose, apps should be as
				easy and obvious to use as possible. With this in mind, it is clear that if a suite
				of apps follows a few strong design patterns then the overall user experience is
				better for it.</p>

			<p class="p">To this end, there are a small number of design patterns that will be presented here;
				each of them is supported by the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp> controls. Furthermore, these
				design patterns form the basis of the SAP Fiori designs, so by following a design
				pattern approach described here, the app that you build will have a consistent feel
				with existing Fiori apps.</p>

			<p class="p"><img class="image" id="loiof377376842914da7a6716192ecffc9d0__image_qgg_lrs_mn" src="faf980f64034409a81b6a49db570b884.image"/></p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Master-Detail</strong></p>

			<p class="p">Arguably the most common design pattern, the Master-Detail (MD) design pattern is
				used to represent two levels of data hierarchy. Typically this will be a list of
				items, shown in the master, and innformation for a selected item shown in the
				detail. This pattern is directly supported by the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.SplitApp</samp>
				control, which itself inherits from the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.SplitContainer</samp>
				control.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Master-Master-Detail</strong></p>

			<p class="p">This Master-Master-Detail (MMD) pattern is a variation on Master-Detail and is designed to
				allow an extra level of drill down through a three level data hierarchy. The
				Shopping Cart demo app in the UI5 SDK shows an example of this pattern in action:
				the user first chooses a product category in the "Master1" list, then selects a
				product from the "Master2" list, for which information is then displayed in the
				detail.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Full Screen</strong></p>

			<p class="p">Typically used in analytical applications and visualizations, this Full Screen (FS)
				pattern is hopefully self-explanatory.</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Multi Flow</strong></p>

			<p class="p">This pattern is used when the app functionality is too complex for a single pattern.
				It consists of the Full Screen and Master-Detail patterns, so is not a departure
				from what we've seen already; rather a combination of known (and therefore expected)
				UI presentations.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Business Scenario</div><div type="Business Scenario"><p class="p">We are almost ready to start building our app. First,
				though, let's have a look what it's going to do. While deliberately straightforward,
				it uses many design aspects and features described in this guide. It is a simple
				front-end to the classic orthwind product backend service. It will allow us to list
				and view details on products, and also to add new products.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">The Northwind
					Service</strong></p>
<p class="p">The Northwind product backend service is an OData service with
				a simple set of entities and relations between them. In fact, there are different
				versions of the service, but in general, all have the common denominator set of
				Product, Category and Supplier entity and entitysets. Each of these are related, as
				follows: </p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loiof377376842914da7a6716192ecffc9d0__fig_twz_dw2_pn"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loiof377376842914da7a6716192ecffc9d0__image_ihg_fqz_4n" src="dd4447edfdba4108bf55f9bd5f27c0b5.image"/></div></div>
<p class="p">The Product entity has an association to the Supplier
				entity and also an association to the Category entity where the associations are *
				to 0..1. Practically speaking, a Product may have a Supplier and a Category, and all
				the pre-existing Products do. </p>
<p class="p">The version of the Northwind service we'll be
				using (V2) is read-write, which means our app can perform OData operations other
				than just READ and QUERY. To allow this, there is session information embedded in
				the URL. Here's the URL to the service as specified in the app's configuration:
					</p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">http://services.odata.org/V2/(S(sapuidemotdg))/OData/OData.svc/</samp>
			</p>
<p class="p">You can see that it's version V2, and that there's a session ID "sapuidemotdg"
				which we've picked. You can pick whatever you like for your own session.
					</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Functionality</strong></p>
<p class="p">The app's functionality is simple. It presents
				a list of existing products, and displays detailed information when one is selected.
				The detailed information is comprised of basic Product data, supplier information
				and category information. Navigation is such that you can go to the details for a
				specific Product (given the Product's key) directly, via a URL. </p>
<p class="p">You can also
				bring up an entry form to add a new Product, which will then appear in the existing
				product list (and is saved in the backend). When creating the Product, there is the
				chance to specify to which Supplier and Category the new Product should be related.
				Note that the new Product form has little to no input validation, as that is not the
				point of the exercise here. </p>
