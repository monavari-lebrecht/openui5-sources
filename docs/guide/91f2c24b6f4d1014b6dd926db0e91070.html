<h1 class="title topictitle1">Right-to-Left Support in Controls</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="p">Unicode defines the direction in which a browser arranges characters to form words. CSS 2.1
			also provides a <samp class="ph codeph">direction</samp> property. The <samp class="ph codeph">dir</samp> attribute
			in HTML overrides the overall direction of blocks and influences the text alignment, if
			not set explicitely. The <samp class="ph codeph">lang</samp> attribute does <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span>
			influence the text direction.</p>
<p class="p">It is possible to use <samp class="ph codeph">document.dir</samp> for text direction. The browser
			supports it and it can be set in the bootstrap. However, if it is set too early, webkit
			seems to reset this to LTR. The <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;BDO&gt;</samp> tag in HTML turns off the
			bidirectional algorithm: The character order is then not reversed if RTL and LTR words
			are mixed.</p>
<p class="p">This means in a nutshell: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">
				<p class="p">Each character inherently belongs to a RTL or LTR script (defined by Unicode). Some
					characters like parentheses and dots have no inherent directionality. Browsers
					know this.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Single words equal character sequences with same directionality. For these, the browser knows
					the text direction and handles them as a sort of blocks that get their internal
					text direction <strong class="ph b">only</strong> from the used characters.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">These words/sequences/"runs" are separated by the direction-neutral characters
					like parentheses and dots - and obviously when character directionality changes.
				</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">The direction in which these blocks are put next to each other depends on the
					base direction.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">The default base direction of HTML is left-to-right, but can be inverted by setting the
					attribute <samp class="ph codeph">"dir='rtl'"</samp>, either on the
						<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;html&gt;</samp> tag or on any subregion which should have a
					different base direction.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">This base direction also determines the default text alignment, the order of columns in
					tables and the presentation of some direction-neutral characters: opening
					parentheses are still opening parentheses when RTL mode is switched. This means
					they render horizontally flipped.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">The algorithm for ordering words/runs/blocks according to the base direction only
					covers one level of mixed directionality. To achieve deeper nesting, spans with
					dir attribute can be used o define a subcontext with different base direction.
				</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">While (as said above) words/runs internally always have the text direction implied by the
					used characters, this behavior can also be overridden by using the
						<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;bdo&gt;</samp> tag or via CSS
						<samp class="ph codeph">unicode-bidi:bidi-override</samp>) when the order of characters
					must follow the base direction regardless of the inherent character direction.
					For example, because the characters do not form a word but are really just a
					list of characters, such as in a part number. </p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">lang</samp> attribute defining the document language does not have any
					influence on directionality. </p>

			</li>
</ul>

					<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
						<p class="p">The W3C officially recommends to use the HTML attribute instead of the
							CSS properties as directionality is determined by content and has
							nothing to do with the presentation. Another reason is that CSS
							properties can be ignored. It is also recommended to use the
								<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;HTML&gt;</samp> tag instead of the
