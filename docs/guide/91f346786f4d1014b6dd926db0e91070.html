<div class="body"><p class="p">The following sections describe how to use the SAPUI5 Repository and how to deploy the SAPUI5
			application project on the ABAP Server. For this application type, the ABAP Server is
			used as a file share to serve browser requests. The SAPUI5 Repository is technically
			based on the BSP Repository of the ABAP Server. The BSP repository is only used as a
			repository or storage for SAPUI5 application files; the BSP runtime, however, is not
			used at runtime and, hence, the flow logic ABAP parts cannot be used as they are not
			executed at runtime.</p>

			<p class="p">The SAPUI5 repository is available in SAP Business Suite systems with version 7.00 or higher
				containing the User Interface Add-On for SAP NetWeaver, which contains the software
				component <samp class="ph codeph">UI_INFRA</samp>. The team repository provider functionality,
				which is available in the Eclipse IDE, is available in SAP Business Suite systems
				with version <strong class="ph b">7.31</strong> containing the User Interface Add-On, which contains the
				software components <samp class="ph codeph">UI_INFRA</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">UI5_731</samp>. </p>

			<p class="p">The used SAPUI5 libraries are available in SAP Business Suite systems with version
				7.00 or higher containing the NetWeaver UI Add-On in the software component
					<samp class="ph codeph">UISAPUI5</samp>.</p>

			<p class="p">As of NetWeaver 7.40 SP1 all required SAPUI5 parts are already part of software
				component <samp class="ph codeph">SAP_UI</samp>.</p>

			<p class="p">As an alternative for SAP Business Suite system of version 7.00 and higher you can
				use an interactive ABAP report offering similiar functionality. For more

			<p class="p">When uploading the files to the SAPUI repository, you can perform a virus scan. </p>

			<p class="p">As of SAP NetWeaver 7.00, SAP delivers the following virus scan profile for ABAP with the UI
				Add-On: <samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/UI5_INFRA_APP/REP_DT_PUT</samp>. </p>

			<p class="p">This profile is used by the SAPUI5 repository API to store files in the SAPUI5
				repository based on BSP repository. For example: Upload of a local file using SAPUI5
				repository API <samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/CL_REP_DT</samp>, method
					<samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/IF_UI5_REP_DT~PUT_FILE</samp> from NetWeaver 7.00 on, or the
				SAPUI5 team repository provider in NetWeaver 7.31 or 7.40. </p>

			<p class="p">The profile is deactivated when delivered. To activate it, create at least one basis
				profile. You can then activate one of the delivered profiles. By default, it links
				to a reference profile, which is the default profile. </p>
