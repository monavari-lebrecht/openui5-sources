<div class="body"><div class="section" id="loio91ef99ad6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_F7E2A69BD6F442ECA8C079090C21CA2B"><div class="section_title">Server</div><div type="Server"> 
		 
		<p class="p">The UI development toolkit for HTML5 (SAPUI5) is comprised of a server and a client component
				for both the SAPUI5 tools and runtime. The support and maintenance strategy of both
				parts differs from the general SAP NetWeaver support and maintenance strategy, see
					<a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=http://service.sap.com/maintenance">SAP Maintenance
					Strategy<img src="images/sap_link.png" class="link-sap" alt="Information published on SAP site" title="Information published on SAP site" border="0"/></a>. The SAPUI5 components are downward-compatible software
				components and follow the same strategy as the SAP GUI. They can be replaced by a
				higher software component version during the lifetime of the software product
				version they are built into without adaptations or changes to other software
				component versions within the relevant software product version. Therefore, the
				SAPUI5 software component versions are usually not maintained for the entire
				maintenance period of the software product version they are built into. Instead,
				they have to be replaced by a higher software component version.</p>
 
		<p class="p">Downward-compatible means, for example, for SAP NetWeaver ABAP that starting with SAP NetWeaver
				UI extensions add-on SP01, the most current client version of SAPUI5 runtime and
				tools will always be compatible with all future SAP NetWeaver support packages. We
				recommend, therefore, that customers apply the most recent client updates of SAPUI5
				tools and runtime on a regular basis. As the SAPUI5 tools client has many
				dependencies, this may require additional updates.</p>

		<p class="p">SAPUI5 tools are build into Eclipse, but are <strong class="ph b">not</strong> shipped as a bundle with Eclipse, but
				separately as an Eclipse p2 repository. Eclipse is supported for different
				individual platforms. The support of individual platforms also depends on the
				support of the operating systems by the manufacturers. SAP cannot provide support
				for a platform or for an operating system which is no longer supported by its vendor
				or manufacturer. In the same sense, SAP cannot provide support for an Eclipse
				version or any other Open Source software version, which is no longer supported by
				the Eclipse Foundation or the Open Source community. </p>
