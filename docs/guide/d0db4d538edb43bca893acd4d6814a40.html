<div class="section"><div class="section_title">How can I adapt the visuals of a control?</div><div type="How can I adapt the visuals of a control?"><p class="p">While there is always the
				option to create a new Theme, this is overkill for most minor style adaptations. For
				those minor changes, the recommendation is to include additional CSS into the page
				which changes the style of the respective tags of the SAPUI5 control. This allows
				complete, arbitrary changes of the visual design - after all it is the same
				technology that the UI5 controls use for their styling.</p>
<p class="p"> The main options
				are:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ul_dkq_lsy_c4"><li class="li">Inspect the HTML and CSS of a control and write a similar, but adapted CSS rule
					for a CSS property you want to override for all controls of a type.</li>
<li class="li">Call <samp class="ph codeph">.addStyleClass("myStyle") </samp>on some control instances if you
					want only those instances to look different than other instances - and then
					write CSS code that refers to the normal classes/tags AND to this CSS class you
					just added.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ul_rdg_g3s_f4"><li class="li">With this high degree of power and flexibility comes quite some
						responsibility. With CSS you are perfectly capable of destroying the
						functionality of a control. This is no SAPUI5-specific thing, but when you
						do CSS adaptions, you should always have good knowledge of this open
						standard.</li>
<li class="li">The inner structure of a control, the tag hierarchy, the IDs and CSS classes
						are NOT part of the public control API that we guarantee to stay stable.
						This is also the case in other UI libraries which may define some CSS
						classes as stable, but not everything else. As CSS can refer to the inner
						structures of a control, you have to accept the risk that your style changes
						break when we change the inner structure. Changing the inner structure is a
						freedom we absolutely need to reserve, so we can fix bugs and add features
						to a control, so this is nothing that can be discussed.</li>
<li class="li">When your CSS does not work as expected, use Firebug or the Internet
						Explorer F12 developer tools or similar tools to inspect the page and check
						which CSS rules are applied to the respective tag - and which rules may be
						applied, but overridden by other rules. If your rules are overwritten by
						other rules, this is probably because of either the order of appearance
						(last rule wins) or because of the CSS selector specificity (more specific
						CSS selectors win). If the latter sounds strange to you, look it up in the
						CSS spec or on Google.</li>

<strong class="ph b">DON'Ts</strong>:<ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ul_xkq_lsy_c4"><li class="li">Do not adapt the style attribute of HTML elements belonging to SAPUI5 controls.
					When these controls are re-rendered, the changes will be lost.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Why do SAPUI5 controls not have a 'style' property where I can do arbitrary changes?</div><div type="Why do SAPUI5 controls not have a 'style' property where I can do arbitrary changes?">
			
			<p class="p">One tricky thing is that a control usually does not map to ONE HTML element, but to a whole
				tree of HTML elements. Whatever is set to the 'style' property we would probably add
				to the root element of this HTML tree – and only there, so you have no 'style'
				access to inner parts. If you just want to override the height of a button, this
				would actually work. But as soon as things get more complex, it will not work that
				easy. And “more complex” already starts with the height of a
					<span class="ph uicontrol">ComboBox</span>. The outer <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;div&gt;</samp> will get
				the proper height, yes. And incidentally also the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;input&gt;</samp> tag
				inside, as it has 100% height set. But the dropdown arrow and the respective
				button-kind-of-thing has a fixed height and the whole control will look pretty
				broken, then.</p>

			<p class="p">In other cases, when HTML elements are nested that break the CSS inheritance chain
				e.g. like a <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;table&gt;</samp> does for font settings, you may change
				the “style” to a different font and text color, but it will just do nothing.</p>

			<p class="p">In general, we try to expose the obvious adaptation stuff in the API, for example the button
				height. But the less obvious adaptations may require support inside the control to
				work properly and as we cannot foresee and support everything you can do with a
				'style' property, we raise the bar a little bit by requiring you to write CSS
				(potentially using <samp class="ph codeph">.addStyleClass(…)</samp> on the respective control).
				With CSS you can do what you cannot do with a 'style' property: tweak the inner HTML
				components of a control.</p>

			<p class="p">Plus: SAP applications (at least the more traditional ones – currently this seems to
				be less of a rule, but I’m not sure it will stay like this forever) need to conform
				to some visual design guideline and in general it is not even desired that
				applications change the TextField height or used font however they like. As you can
				use CSS, UI5 still supports that, but we shouldn’t make breaking the visual design
				an option in our official API.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">How can I provide additional CSS which is not overwritten by the SAPUI5 CSS?</div><div type="How can I provide additional CSS which is not overwritten by the SAPUI5 CSS?"><p class="p">When SAPUI5 is used "normally" (which means: loaded by a<samp class="ph codeph">
					&lt;script&gt;</samp> element in the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;head&gt;</samp> of a page,
				all libraries declared in the respective attribute of the script tag), it is
				sufficient to just add the custom CSS at any place after the SPAUI5
					<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;script&gt;</samp> element. SAPUI5 will insert its CSS links
				immediately after the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;script&gt;</samp> tag, so any later CSS will
				appear later in the document and can thus overwrite the SAPUI5 CSS.</p>
<p class="p">However,
				it is important to understand the precedence rules of CSS! </p>
<p class="p"> The order of
				appearance is <strong class="ph b">not the only factor</strong> deciding which one of two or more
				conflicting rules wins. Actually it is only the least important factor. In practice,
				the most important (and maybe least known) factor is the "specificity" of the
				selector belonging to a rule. </p>
<p class="p"> For example, if one rule says <samp class="ph codeph">button
					{color:red;} </samp>to make all button texts red and a second rule says
					<samp class="ph codeph">div &gt; button {color:green;}</samp> to make all texts green in
				buttons which are direct children of a <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;div&gt;</samp> element, the
				second rule always wins, if applicable, because it is more specific. The order of
				appearance in the document does not matter in this case. It would only matter if
				both rules would start with an equal selector like
					<samp class="ph codeph">button{color:***}</samp>.</p>
<p class="p"> The order of loading is completely
				irrelevant, only the position in the document counts in this case.</p>
<p class="p">If you load
				SAPUI5 not with a <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;script&gt;</samp> tag in the
					<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;head&gt;</samp>, or if you did not specify all used control
				libraries in the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;script&gt; </samp>tag, but loaded some lateron when
				the body was already loaded, you can still make sure a custom CSS appears later in
				the document by loading it with <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.includeStyleSheet(stylesheetUrl[,
					id]) </samp><strong class="ph b">after</strong> loading SAPUI5 or the dynamically loaded control
				library.</p>

			<p class="p">If you want to change some styling and use <samp class="ph codeph">control.addStyleClass(…)</samp> to add a
				CSS class, but it does not seem to work, you first have to understand WHAT is not
				working:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ol_xnq_lsy_c4"><li class="li"> Is the style class not added to the HTML?</li>
<li class="li"> Or is the style class correctly added, but the style you supplied is not
					applied by the browser?</li>
</ul>

			<p class="p">You can check this by inspecting the HTML with your browser's developer tools/ web
				inspector.</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ul_u4q_lsy_c4"><li class="li">If the style class is really not added to a control (which is rather unlikely),
					it would be a bug that needs to be reported and fixed. Note: some entities are
					not Controls, but only Elements (inherit from
						<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Element</samp>). They only sometimes have support for
						<samp class="ph codeph">addStyleClass</samp>.</li>
<li class="li">If the style class is there in the HTML, the bug is inside the CSS styles you
					supplied: <ul class="ul" id="loiod0db4d538edb43bca893acd4d6814a40__ul_arq_lsy_c4"><li class="li">Are they loaded by the browser?</li>
<li class="li">Are the selectors matching the element you want to style? You can again
							check in the developer tools: they mostly list all styles which would
							apply, but some are overriding others (those others are usually listed
							striked-through). If your style is not listed at all, your CSS selector
							seems to be wrong.</li>
<li class="li">If your selector is fine, but other style rules override your styles
							(potentially those from the original UI5 theme), then the CSS precedence
							rules decided this. Please read the section "How can I provide
							additional CSS which is not overwritten by the UI5 CSS?" above and see
								<a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#cascading-order">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#cascading-order<img src="images/3rd_link.png" class="link-external" alt="Information published on non-SAP site" title="Information published on non-SAP site" border="0"/></a> for
							the respective part of the CSS spec and <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity<img src="images/3rd_link.png" class="link-external" alt="Information published on non-SAP site" title="Information published on non-SAP site" border="0"/></a> for more
							on specificity.</li>
<li class="li">It could also be that your browser does not understand the CSS styles
							you have written. Some browsers still display them in the developer
							tools, some don't, so you may want to try changing very common styles
							like the border to check whether selector and specificity are fine.</li>
