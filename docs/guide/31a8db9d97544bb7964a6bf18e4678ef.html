<h1 class="title topictitle1">Step 7: Model View Controller</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"/>
<p class="p">Right now, the error in the console is suggesting that an App view, specifically the file
				<span class="ph filepath">App.view.xml</span>, is missing. Let's take this opportunity to step
			back and look at what we're going to build. </p>
<p class="p">We're using the Model View Controller (MVC) concept, and this starts with a root View
			that the Component instantiates - the App view. This view is rather simple, in that it
			contains just a single control - an <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.SplitApp</samp> - and does not have
			a corresponding controller. There is no requirement for a controller as the routing and
			navigation logic is provided by the Router that we've already defined. </p>
<p class="p">Further, there's no requirement for any great detail in the <samp class="ph codeph">SplitApp</samp>, as the
			aggregation content is also controlled by the Router. This is what the App view looks
			like, in its entirety:</p>
<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint"><samp class="ph codeph">#!xml</samp>
&lt;mvc:View
	xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"
	displayBlock="true"
	xmlns="sap.m"&gt;
	&lt;SplitApp id="idAppControl" /&gt;
&lt;/mvc:View&gt;
</pre></div>
<p class="p">A SplitApp is a so-called 'container' control, and inheriting from
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.NavContainer</samp>, has two container sections, in the form of
			aggregations: <samp class="ph codeph">masterPages</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">detailPages</samp>. These
			aggregations, as we already saw in the Routing configuration in the Component, are
			managed by the Router, and we don't need to specify anything directly here. While we're
			already getting some separation of concerns, it's more from the fact that we're using a
			container control. We're going to go one level deeper and use the MVC approach within
			the contained controls. The 'pages' suffix of these aggregation names suggest that the
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Page</samp> is a candidate for aggregation, however, we're
			aggregating views, as we can see in the Routing configuration. This is a common pattern. </p>
<p class="p">Aggregating views within the SplitApp container control allows us to develop the
			different parts of the app independently, handling the UI and logic in discrete
			sections. We've already seen the component overview schematic in Part 1, so let's look
			at a tree-based summary of the controls and MVC elements now (all filenames are relative
			to the app's root folder):</p>
<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">
control:UIComponent (Component.js)
 |
 +-- view:App (view/App.view.xml)
      |
      +-- control:SplitApp
           |
           +-- aggregation:masterPages
           |    |
           |    +-- view:Master (view/Master.view.xml)
           |         |
           |         +-- controller: Master (view/Master.controller.js)
           |
           +-- aggregation:detailPages
                 |
                 +-- view:Detail (view/Detail.view.xml)
                 |    |
                 |    +-- controller:Detail (view/Detail.controller.js)
                 |
                 +-- view:NotFound (view/NotFound.view.xml)
                 |
                 +-- view:AddProduct (view/AddProduct.view.xml)
                      |
                      +-- controller:AddProduct (view/AddProduct.controller.js)
</pre></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Progress Check</div><div type="Progress Check">
			
			<p class="p">We'll add the App view, and also a couple of temporary skeleton XML declarations for
				the Master and Detail views (this is mostly so we can see a little bit of progress).
				Our skeleton XML declarations for the Master and Detail views look like this:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint"><samp class="ph codeph">#!xml</samp>
&lt;mvc:View xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc" /&gt;</pre></div>

			<p class="p">In other words, completely empty views. Now our app folder content now looks like
				this:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">
tdg/
  |
  +-- i18n/
  |     |
  |     +-- messageBundle.properties
  |
  +-- view/
  |     |
  |     +-- App.view.xml
  |     +-- Detail.view.xml
  |     +-- Master.view.xml
  |
  +-- Component.js
  +-- index.html
  +-- MyRouter.html</pre></div>

			<p class="p">At this stage things look a little more interesting than the previous empty screen.
				We can see the core structure of the SplitApp.</p>

			<div class="fig fignone"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio31a8db9d97544bb7964a6bf18e4678ef__image_g32_wds_4n" src="731b5c4bd26f42daa77e79ccc40247ca.image"/></div></div>

			<p class="p">There are no relevant error messages in the console - the runtime is delivering exactly what
				we asked for (a couple of empty views in the <samp class="ph codeph">SplitApp</samp> container
				control).</p>

			<p class="p">In fact, because there's now actually something visible, let's have a look at an
				alternative screenshot, where the browser window is maximised to full screen:</p>

			<div class="fig fignone"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio31a8db9d97544bb7964a6bf18e4678ef__image_uvz_wds_4n" src="507ef43bc95d4a83969cb1b94e248de6.image"/></div></div>

			<p class="p">Here we can see that the Master and Detail aggregation proportions remain, despite the extreme
				width of the browser window; there are margins on the left and right sides. This is
				due to the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Shell</samp> control that we introduced in the
					<span class="ph filepath">index.html</span>.</p>
