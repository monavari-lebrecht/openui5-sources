<p class="p">SAPUI5 is a client UI technology based on JavaScript, CSS and HTML5. SAPUI5 applications run in
			a browser. Depending on the device the application is to run on (mobile, tablet or
			desktop PC), you use different UI libraries. </p>
<p class="p">Servers come into play for deploying your applications, storing the SAPUI5 libraries and
			connecting to a database. Depending on the environment in which SAPUI5 is used, the
			libraries or your applications are stored on an SAP NetWeaver Application Server or an
			SAP HANA Cloud platform, for instance.  the preferred way to access business data for
			your application is using the OData model through a SAP NetWeaver Gateway. </p>
<p class="p">When  users access an SAPUI5 application from their device, a request is sent to the respective
			server to load the application into the browser. The view accesses the relevant
			libraries. Usually the model is also instantiated and business data is fetched from the
			database.</p>

			<p class="p">SAPUI5 uses the model view controller (MVC) concept to achieve the following objectives: </p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Propose file structure, naming, and usage patterns </p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Add capability of UI declaration (in comparison to a programmatic
						construction) </p>
