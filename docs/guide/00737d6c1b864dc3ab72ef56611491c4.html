<h1 class="title topictitle1">Cyclic Dependencies</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"/>
<p class="p">The functionality in two modules can be interdependent, for example, module A requires module B
			to execute, and module B requires module A. The <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp>
			function ensures that the execution of a calling module only continues when the
			required module has been loaded and executed. Consequently, cyclic dependencies cannot
			be resolved and would cause an endless series of requests
			(A-&gt;B-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;...).</p>
<p class="p">To avoid this, use the following workaround: As soon as a module A has been loaded and is about
			to execute, it is regarded as <em class="ph i">declared</em>. So, when this module A embeds another
			module B which has not been loaded, module B will be loaded and executed. If B now again
			requires A, then the dependency resolution runtime will find that A has been declared
			already (despite the fact that its execution has not been finished yet) and simply
			returns. This workaround helps to break the endless loop, but it doesn't re-ensure the
			original promise of <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">Cyclic modules have to deal with that gap on their own. There are several ways/best
			practices how to do this: </p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio00737d6c1b864dc3ab72ef56611491c4__ul_oly_lsr_m4"><li class="li">
				<p class="p">Variant 1: Merge A and B </p>

				<p class="p">If the conflicts can not be resolved easily, or if the modules are so highly
					related that they will be used together most of the time, then merging them into
					one module is the most simple solution. </p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p"> Variant 2: Interlaced Execution of A and B </p>

				<p class="p">This variant makes use of the fact that the module loading takes place exactly at
					the source location where the jQuery.sap.require function is executed. Let's
					assume that the content of modules A and B can be structured as follows: </p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">// Module A, Part A.1
   

    // Module Section A.1, does not depend on Module B and provides all code that module B depends on.


    jQuery.sap.require("B");


    // Module Section A.2, might depend on code in Module Section B.1</pre></div>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">// Module B, Part B.1
  

    // Module Section B.1, does not depend on Module A and provides all code that module A depends on.


    jQuery.sap.require("A");


    // Module Section B.2, might depend on code in Module Section A.1</pre></div>

				<p class="p">Further assume (WLOG) that module A is loaded first. Then section A.1 will be
					executed and will be available to the outside world before the
						<samp class="ph codeph">require('B')</samp> is executed. During the require, the framework
					will detect that B is not available yet, will load and execute it. The execution
					starts with section B.1 which succeeds as it does not depend on A. When the
					execution of B reaches the <samp class="ph codeph">require('A')</samp> statement, the
					framework detects that A has been loaded already and continues without loading A
					again. But remember, that the code from section A.2 is not available yet. The
					execution of B however continues and succeeds as - by assumption - B.2 does not
					depend on A.2. Now, the first <samp class="ph codeph">require('B')</samp> succeeds and returns
					and section A.2 will be executed. And it might use the code from section B.1.
				</p>

			</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Procedure and result are similar in the case that B is loaded first. </p>
