<p class="p">UI5 is a relatively young toolkit and is continually being developed, extended and improved.
			The toolkit's power and flexibility is somewhat of a double-edged sword. With the core
			features such as MVC, module and resource management, data models, routing, resource
			bundles and more, and with the options therein, it is not uncommon for a developer
			starting out with UI5 to wonder where to start, or at least what the best practices are. </p>
<p class="p">Hopefully this guide has provided you with a compass, a sense of direction. We have tried
			to distill the essence of a typical Fiori-style app into something small and
			straightforward to understand. Of course, not all apps will look like the one presented
			in this guide. But to build an enterprise scale app that is independent, addressable,
			UI-focused, responsive, accessible, translateable and maintainable, you should aim to
			use the mechanisms and features in a similar was to how they're presented here.</p>
<p class="p">Good luck, and happy coding with UI5! </p>
