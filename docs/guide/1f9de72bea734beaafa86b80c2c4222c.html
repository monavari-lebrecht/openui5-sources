<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> SAPUI5 event delegation is adapted and the <samp class="ph codeph">ontouch</samp> or
				<samp class="ph codeph">ontap</samp> functions on the control prototype are called on both touch
			and mouse (exclude the emulated mouse events on touch interfaces) events. This enables
			the controls which only uses SAPUI5 event delegation for event handling to work
			seamlessly on Windows 8 touch-enabled devices without being changed. So for you as an
			SAPUI5 application developer there is no need to change or adapt your applications to
			support devices that allow input from both mouse and touch.</div>
<p class="p">When you develop your own controls, then there are some things to consider: </p>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Background: How SAPUI5 handles events</div><div type="Background: How SAPUI5 handles events">
			
			<p class="p">With the introduction of touch-enabled Window 8 devices, touch is becoming part of the
				expected desktop experience. In the past, UI5 statically detected whether the
				running environment supports touch events. Then the assumption was made that only
				touch (and not mouse) events need to be supported. This assumption became faulty
				with the emerge of touch-enabled Windows 8 devices. The fact that touch events are
				supported doesn't mean that user can't use other input device than touch. Therefore
				"support touch" doesn't equal "doesn't need mouse support" anymore. For all these
				reasons, we son't switch between touch and mouse - we now just support them
				both!</p>

			<p class="p">The following figure shows how this is implemented:</p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loio1f9de72bea734beaafa86b80c2c4222c__fig_z1g_xcq_qn"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio1f9de72bea734beaafa86b80c2c4222c__image_tm4_pwk_4n" src="56d796e4026f463ab92c1ec10818f339.image"/></div></div>

			<p class="p">A desktop control is defined as a control that listens to mouse events, whereas a
				mobile control listens to touch events. To ensure that all events can be received,
				for mouse events touch simulation events are created and for touch events mouse
				simulation events, respectively. So the UI Area, which acts as an event delegate,
				receives the correct events. In detail:</p>

			<div class="p"><ul class="ul" id="loio1f9de72bea734beaafa86b80c2c4222c__ul_oh4_vrb_4n"><li class="li">When a mouse event is triggered for a desktop control, it's handed over to
						the UI area directly .</li>
<li class="li">When a mouse event is triggered for a mobile control, a touch event is
						simulated and handed over to the UI area.</li>
<li class="li">When a touch event is triggered for a mobile control, it's handed over to
						the UI area directly . </li>
<li class="li">When a touch event is triggered for a desktop control, a mouse event is
						simulated and handed over to the UI area.</li>
<li class="li">Some browsers send a delayed mouse event after a touch event, this is just
						ignored.</li>
</ul>
So it is ensured that all events can be handled and no event is triggered
				twice.</div>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Support mouse and touch events together</div><div type="Support mouse and touch events together">
			
			<p class="p">Touch interfaces try to emulate mouse and click events obviously because touch
				interfaces need to work with applications that have only interacted with mouse
				events before. Which means for a single tap on touch interfaces, the following
				events are fired in the written order:</p>

			<ol class="ol" id="loio1f9de72bea734beaafa86b80c2c4222c__ol_fmx_sry_mn"><li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">touchstart</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">touchend</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">mousedown</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">mouseup</samp></li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">click</samp></li>
</ol>

			<p class="p">If we support mouse and touch together, the event handler is called twice for a single tap
				because there are touchstart and mousedown fired by the browser. Fortunately, we
				have found a way to set a flag on the emulated mouse events from touch interfaces
				and suppress those events when they reach the event handler.</p>
