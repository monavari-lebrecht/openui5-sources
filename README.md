# OpenUI5 Bower Sources

## Why another bower package with openui5 sources?

Added, because the existing bower packages for openui5 doesn't contain in version 1.22.4 ALL debug files and therefor the execution stopped when OpenUI5 started with bower_components/openui5-bower/resources/sap-ui-core-dbg.js
