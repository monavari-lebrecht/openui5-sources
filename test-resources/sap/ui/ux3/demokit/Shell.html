	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	The Ux3 GoldReflection Shell is an application frame with navigation capabilities.
	<br>
	For the main content navigation <code>worksetItems</code> are used. These items can have a subitems. So a two-level navigation is possible.
	In the content area a control hierarchy (e.g. a MatrixLayout containing form controls) can be displayed.
	<br>
	In the header area some <code>headerItems</code> can be used, this can be text, buttons or menu buttons.
	<br>
	On the left side of the shell there is a toolbar. It contains a search, inspect and feeder function which can be hidden if needed.
	Additionally there other <code>ToolPopups</code> can be added to have application dependent functions.
    Since 1.14, if the ToolPopups added to the toolbar take more space than is available on screen, the toolbar's
    width automatically increases to accomodate more items.
	</p>
    <p>
    The bar on the right side of the screen is called pane-bar. 
    <code>paneBarItems</code> can be added to this bar and are displayed as 
    clickable text. By attaching to the <code>paneBarItemSelected</code>-Event, the
    application can react to user interactions with these items. One example would 
    be to set the content of the pane associated with the clicked icon by using
    <code>setPaneContent</code>.
    Since 1.14, if more items are added to the pane-bar than fit on screen, these additional items 
    will be added to a menu and a button is rendered at the bottom of the bar which gives access to 
    said menu.
    <br/>
    The method <code>setPaneContent</code> accepts any control-tree (control or 
    nested controls), and puts it into the currently active pane in place of the 
    current content. Please keep the reduced space of the pane in mind when adding
    content to it.
    The pane is automatically opened or 
    closed (based on its current state) when the item is clicked. Before opening of 
    the pane, the event <code>paneBarItemSelected</code> is fired. After closing the 
    event <code>paneClosed</code> is fired.
    </p>
    <p>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">
        Please note, that the following setting may not be implemented in every theme.
    </span>
    <br/>
    The shell can be used with different design options that can be changed via the 
    <code>designType</code>-property. The standard-design 
    (<code>sap.ui.ux3.ShellDesignType.Standard</code>) is set as default, the other
    choices are <code>sap.ui.ux3.ShellDesignType.Light</code> and 
    <code>sap.ui.ux3.ShellDesignType.Crystal</code>. Changing the designType
    also influences the header (see <code>headerType</code>-property), as the 
    standard header of the Light and Crystal designs are smaller than the one of the standard 
    (dark) design. The other <code>headerType</code>s are currently not influenced by the 
    design.<br/>
    When the designType is set to <code>sap.ui.ux3.ShellDesignType.Light</code> or 
    <code>sap.ui.ux3.ShellDesignType.Crystal</code>, the inverted-state of all 
    <code>ToolPopup</code>-controls in the shell is set to false, while it is set to true 
    otherwise. The inverted state of the ToolPopups is overwritten, even if it was explicitly set 
    before.
    </p>
    <p>
	The shell is supposed to be added to a direct child of the <code>BODY</code> tag of a page and there should be no other parts of the page consuming space outside the Shell.
	</p>

	<h2>Example</h2>
	<iframe src="ShellExample.html" width="90%" height="500px" name="Example" id="Example">
	</iframe>
	<p>
	The example shows the possibilities of the shell. Real application surely are much more complex.
